### Step 1: Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Vagrant configures a development environment inside of a virtual machine on your development machine. 

Vagrant is easy to install.  Just follow the [instructions](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html)

### Step 2: Get the code
 
clone the [cake-it-web repo](https://github.com/asm-products/cake-it-web)

### Step 3: Setup your development environment with Vagrant

1. Change into the root directory of the cake-it-web code base.  You will see a file named Vagrantfile.  The Vagrantfile contains the instructions that Vagrant will use to create your development environment.  You do **not** need to do anything with this file.
2. Run the "vagrant up" command.  This will take several minutes so grab a coffee.  You will have a virtual machine running on your local machine when this completes.  This will be a fully functionial development environment.
3. Use the "vagrant ssh" to ssh into the shell of the vm.  You will be logged in as the user "vagrant".  The vagrant box shares a folder with the host OS accessible at "/vagrant".  Try running "ls -l /vagrant" from the shell of your vagrant box.  You will see the cake-it-web codebase that you cloned to your host OS.

### Step 4: Install Ruby 2.1.3 and Rails

1. Change into the /vagrant directory within the vagrant shell.  "cd /vagrant"
2. Run `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.1.3` to install RVM.
2. Run `rvm install ruby-2.1.3` to install Ruby 2.1.3.
3. Install Bundler with `gem install bundler`.
4. Configure your environment using the Gemfile with `bundle install`.
5. Sometimes Bundler might give an error saying that "an error occurred while installing pg". In that case, simply run `gem install pg` and then run step 4 again.

### Step 5: Run the application server

1. Execute the command "rails server" to start the app server.
2. Visit localhost:4567 in your web browser.  You should see the cake-it-web application running
